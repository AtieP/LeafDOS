LeafDOS is a real mode, 16 bit diskette operating system that can fit on a 160k floppy.

# Porpouse
Make a stable DOS (nothing related to MS-DOS/FreeDOS), that can have in-built mouse support, in-built PS/2 keyboard and mouse driver, instead of having to install It (i.e MOUSE.COM). Having HÃ©rcules, CGA and VGA native support, and use as less interrupts possible, while still being in real mode.

# How Is the Shell?
There are no in-built commands, everything is a dile/programa that answers to the command ala MS-DOS. (Except Kernel.sys)

# AFPFS what?
See https://wiki.osdev.org/User:Superleaf1995/AFPFS for a short explaination of what Is AFPFS.
