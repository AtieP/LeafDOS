		<h1 id="1.1">Introduction</h1>
		<p>Leaf DOS or Leaf Diskette Operating System is a portable, 80x86 compatible operating system
		desinged to be runt on almost any 80's and 90's platform. Without any kind of restriction.</p>
		<p>One of the main aims of Leaf DOS is to serve as a common DOS (nothing related to MS-DOS/FreeDOS)
		that can satisfy the needs of a operating system in older computers, while being minimalistic
		and incredibly small and fast.</p>
		
		<h1 id="1.1.1">A bit of backstory</h1>
		<p>Leaf DOS came into my mind when i was starting to code in CSS (yep, that stylesheet
		language). And i said myself "why not make an operating system", "it will not be
		so hard". And i will never regret saying that. Then i discovered some <a
		href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Duct_Von_Tape">stuff
		wich i borrowed from internet</a>, so i made a big spaghetti, i didn't understood
		what i was doing, but i did something, and i gave that a name.</p>
		<p>That's my first OS ever made, Zuly OS. The only thing it could do was
		displaying a RSOD on error (Windows BSOD but in red). And if it suceeded
		it overwrote itself somehow.</p>
		<p>I saw no future, since i didn't understood what i was doing. So i
		decided to learn something else.</p>
		<p>By casuality or destinity i ended up reading tutorialspoint's C course, i
		liked C so much that i decided to code in it. Once i started to code
		i made Economitopia 0.1, my first program ever made.</p>
		<p>Once again, another thing i thank life for giving me was Turbo C, i was
		looking for that piece of compiler for many time without knowing it. In it
		i made my first videogame (and it was not at all buggy, but the gameplay
		was a bit awful). Once the videogame was made, i made some others, but
		they never reached the level of my first videogame.</p>
		<p>Then my HDD formatted when i tried to re-install Windows 7 because
		it crashed a lot and stopped working.</p>
		<p>I was tired of having BSOD's on Windows, so i decided to switch to
		Linux.</p>
		<p>Once again, luckily i found Debian Linux, and i installed it.</p>
		<p>Stuff happened, I abandoned C coding a bit. But i kept coding
		because i was also making the Leaf Engine.</p>
		<p>I decided to study some assembly to complement my C knowlodge.</p>
		<p>Now i'm here coding Leaf DOS (Leaf OS in early versions).</p>
		
		<h1 id="1.2">Kernel</h1>
		<p>The kernel in Leaf DOS is the core of the operating system (thus a kernel!).</p>
		<p>It is a monolitich kernel (all the stuff resides on the kernel memory space)
		, but it is slowly planed to switch to a microkernel (arbitrarily load drivers)
		so more functionality can be implemented.</p>
		<p>The kernel has null security (real mode already does that), so antivirus
		or any kind of counter-security is not gonna be planned on a future (yet).</p>
		
			<h2 id="1.2.1">What the kernel can do</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Load software</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Provide a shell interface</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Provide programs will call routines (API)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Load foreing software (see <a href="#1.4">Compatibility with other OSes</a></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		
			<h2 id="1.2.2">What the kernel cannot do</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Provide in-built shell programs/commands (all commands are programs!)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Provide a GUI</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Have any form of security (it's not worth it on real-mode)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Load MS-DOS/FreeDOS programs (see <a href="#1.4">Compatibility with other OSes</a></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
		<h1 id="1.3">Operating system schemes</h1>
		<p>It's time for schemes!. Those arent implemented features at time of writing, but
		here are some schemes on planning.</p>
		<img src="PIZZA_STACK.png" width="640px" height="320px"></img>
		<br></br> <!-- some nice break here -->
		<code>How does communication betwen LeafDOS is planned to work</code>
		
		<p>This is a partially-implemented feature, (eveyrthing is implemented but
		the driver memory space).</p>
		<img src="MEMORY_GRAPH.png" width="640px" height="640px"></img>
		<br></br> <!-- some nice break here -->
		<code>How does memory in Leaf DOS is managed</code>
		
		<h1 id="1.4">Compatibility with other OSes</h1>
		<p>Compatibility with other operating systems is limited, however there are some binary
		compatibilities between Leaf DOS programs and other operating system software:</p>
